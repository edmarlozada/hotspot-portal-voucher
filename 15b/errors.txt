# This file contains error messages which are shown to user, when http/https
# login is used.
# These messages can be changed to make user interface more friendly, including
# translations to different languages.
#
# Various variables can be used here as well. Most frequently used ones are:
# $(error-orig) - original error message from hotspot
# $(ip) - ip address of a client
# $(username) - username of client trying to log in

# internal-error
# It should never happen. If it will, error page will be shown
# displaying this error message (error-orig will describe what has happened)

internal-error = internal.error

# config-error
# Should never happen if hotspot is configured properly.

config-error = config.error

# not-logged-in
# Will happen, if status or logout page is requested by user,
# which actually is not logged in

not-logged-in = not.logged.in

# ippool-empty
# IP address for user is to be assigned from ip pool, but there are no more
# addresses in that pool

ippool-empty = ippool.empty

# shutting-down
# When shutdown is executed, new clients are not accepted

shutting-down = shutting.down

# user-session-limit
# If user profile has limit of shared-users, then this error will be shown
# after reaching this limit

user-session-limit = session.limit

# license-session-limit
# Depending on licence number of active hotspot clients is limited to
# one or another amount. If this limit is reached, following error is displayed.

license-session-limit = license.limit

# wrong-mac-username
# If username looks like MAC address (12:34:56:78:9a:bc), but is not
# a MAC address of this client, login is rejected

wrong-mac-username = invalid.mac.user

# chap-missing
# If http-chap login method is used, but hotspot program does not receive
# back encrypted password, this error message is shown.
# Possible reasons of failure:
#  - JavaScript is not enabled in web browser;
#  - login.html page is not valid;
#  - challenge value has expired on server (more than 1h of inactivity);
#  - http-chap login method is recently removed;
# If JavaScript is enabled and login.html page is valid,
# then retrying to login usually fixes this problem.

chap-missing = chap.missing

# invalid-username
# Most general case of invalid username or password. If RADIUS server
# has sent an error string with Access-Reject message, then it will
# override this setting.

invalid-username = invalid.user

# invalid-mac
# Local users (on hotspot server) can be bound to some MAC address. If login
# from different MAC is tried, this error message will be shown.

invalid-mac = invalid.mac

# uptime-limit, traffic-limit
# For local hotspot users in case if limits are reached

uptime-limit = uptime.limit
traffic-limit = traffic.limit

# radius-timeout
# User is authenticated by RADIUS server, but no response is received from it,
# following error will be shown.

radius-timeout = radius.timeout

# auth-in-progress
# Authorization in progress. Client already has issued an authorization request
# which is not yet complete.

auth-in-progress = auth.in.progress

# radius-reply
# Radius server returned some custom error message

radius-reply = radius.reply
